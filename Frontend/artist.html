      <div class="info-row">
        <div class="info-value">Shiva’s joy and delight is Nandi, his bovine mount. No animal in the sacred myths &
          folklore of India is more adored and revered than this elegant icon dating back to Harappan seals,
          Ajanta-Ellora frescoes, rock sculptures and temple icons welcoming the faithful from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. A
          bedrock of eternal values upholding the four pillars of faith: Sathya (truth), Dharma (Righteousness), Shanti
          (Peace) and Prema (Love), Nandi is the most beloved symbol of purity, patience and piety. Its elegant and
          stylized form is seen in all Indian folk art traditions like Bhil, Gond, Pichwai , Patta and even in abstract
          works by modern artists.

          Chandrakant Tajbije has created a brilliant blend of tradition with modernity using folk, tantric and symbolic
          forms in a pictorial style that bursts with life. He makes imaginative use of bold colour schemes and textures
          in vibrant acrylic that cast a spell on the viewer. Chandrakant’s “Nandi” is not only a joy to behold but an
          inspired invocation of the power of innocence, love and piety. In Seeing is Feeling & Being!</div>

          Dilip Chaudhury has been painting various scenes from everyday life of Calcutta & sometimes Banaras, in
          watercolor. From ancient monuments, streets & ghats, to a rickshaw puller in action, he’s captured it all,
          beautifully. To somebody who has even a remote connection with Calcutta, he manages to bring a wave of
          nostalgia, as he symbolizes the character of the city of joy in his work.</div>

          Ganesh’s artowrk Each of his paintings brings different moods, colors and emotions. They are the true

          pure and organic form.
